      summary: `Research on the effect of ultrasonic waves on the kinetics of chemical reactions in two-phase systems. Reactions between two different phases are usually slow and ineffective. The Phase Transfer Catalyst (PTC) technique provides a powerful alternative to the usual methods for conducting this kind of reactions. The purpose of our research was to study the effect of ultrasonic waves on three different heterogeneous systems: 
      
      1. Cannizzaro Reaction catalyzed by phase transfer catalyst
      2. The saponification of some vegetable oils
      3. The lsomerization of Maleic to Fumaric acid

      The results showed that the ultrasonic waves has dramatically accelerates on the mentioned reactions and can be used instead of PTC under same specific conditions.`,
